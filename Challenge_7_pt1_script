## REALLY bad and inefficient. But it works. Just let it run for a few seconds before stopping.
## Once CTRL+C'd, do a $bags.Count command to get the total. But it includes the shiny gold bag, so minus one for answer
## Could be made more efficient with hashtables (color=0, value of 0 means not checked) but I had a hard time with that. 


$file=(Get-Content C:\Users\cesamps\Desktop\colors.txt)

$bags=@("shiny gold")
$separator="bags contain"

while(1 -eq 1)
{
    foreach($key in $bags)
    {
        foreach($line in $file)
        {
            $splitLine = $line -split $separator
            $color =  $splitLine[0]
            $contents = $splitLine[1]
            if($contents -like "*$key*")
            {
                if($bags -notcontains $color)
                {
                    $bags += $color
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
